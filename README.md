# Hidden Markov Models with an application in seabird tracking GPS data 

Sumbitted as part of my second project in the scopes of my MSc Statistics with Data Science in the University of Edinburgh.

The scope of this project was to explore and validate whether Hidden Markov Models can be used to infer the behavioural states behind tern tracking movement data 
and use them to identify potential foraging areas.

Packages: 

Use of the R package moveHMM is primarily demonstrated, along with ggplot2 and tidyverse for visualisation/mapping and data cleaning respectively.


Files within the repository:

HMM Dissertation.pdf -  PDF file of my report, offering an overview of the project's methods and more insight in Hidden Markov Models
HMM Project.rmd  - Markdown file for the code used. 
HMM Project.html - HTML version of the above file, with printed outputs (plots, maps and summmary statistics).
