# Hidden Markov Models with an application in seabird tracking GPS data

Sumbitted as part of my second project in the scopes of my MSc Statistics with Data Science in the University of Edinburgh.

The scope of this project was to explore and validate whether Hidden Markov Models can be used to infer the behavioural states behind tern tracking movement data 
and use them to identify potential foraging areas.

The R package moveHMM, commonly used in ecology, was used.
